## Prerequisites

This is React Native application, which uses Redux for managing the state.

## Goals

The application helps to manage tasks by allowing the user to add new tasks and to cross through each of them when completed. The completed state can be toggled to active one again.

## Instructions

User opens the application and writes the name of the task in the text input field. When the task is added to the list, user can cross it through by touching the corresponding item. The state might be changed back on touch.

In order to install the application, please download a zip or clone it via Git and store it to your local directory. Open git and run "expo start" (npm package and expo cli should be installed on the machine), when the development server starts, the Qcode should be scanned with expo application installed on the mobile device (any operating system, currently tested with Android OS). Both devices - a computer running the development server and the mobile device, should use the same LAN, in case of issues, LAN might be changed to Tunnel, with further rescan of the QCode. A complete installation on expo cli instruction is on the official site of React Native: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.
